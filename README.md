# in-real-life

These programs are built to experiment with real-life applications of learned concepts 

The current files support a program to calculate the area of a delivery driver's route. Given a list of coordinates, the area is calculated using the shoelace formula, and stored in a driver object along with the driver's name. The program uses a linked list to allow for handling of an unknown number of drivers and coordinates, as well as sort and search capabilities; the implementation of the latter is still in progress.
